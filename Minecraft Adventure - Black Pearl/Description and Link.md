This is a puzzle and parkour Minecraft adventure map. This took 80+ hours and over 200 commands.

The map is too large for GitHub, so I uploaded it to Google Drive:

To install, put the Map folder in Saves and the Resource Pack folder in Resource Packs. You must load the resource pack before playing because it contains music, voice recordings, and textures that are essential for the experience.

This map was inspired by Myst and as a result you won't be able to beat it if the music stays muted. Overall, it requires some thought and attention to detail to complete.
