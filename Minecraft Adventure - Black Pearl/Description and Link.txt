This is a puzzle and parkour Minecraft adventure map. Players are required to pay close attention to details in order to complete it. This took 80+ hours and over 200 commands.

The map is too large for GitHub, so I uploaded it to Google Drive:

To install, put the Map folder in Saves and the Resource Pack folder in Resource Packs. You must load the resource pack before playing because it contains music, voice recordings, and textures that are essential for the experience. This might be a spoiler, but you can't beat the map without the music.
