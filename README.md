# Creations

Welcome,

I started this repository to serve as a portfolio. Some day I'll migrate this to a formal website, but for now here are some navigation tips: All of the ".md" files can be viewed in your browser by simply clicking on them. The HTML versions are preffered for better viewing. If you want to see a cleaner web page you may download the ".html" file and open it on your computer or prepend the url with "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?" For example: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CUBICinfinity/Creations/blob/master/R%20(The%20Coolest%20Folder)/Statistics/6%20-%20Bee%20Repelant%20-%20Permutation%20Experiment.html

This doesn't contain all of my work. As time goes, I update what is included (excluding items that are confidential). If you want to see more of my work, you can email me at jimkgreene@gmail.com explaining what you'd like to see. I'd also be happy to work on new projects, particularly if they are different from what I've done before.
