# Creations

Welcome,

I started this repository to serve as a portfolio. I found that most people do not know how to navigate it, so I will provide some instruction as I work on migrating this to a formal website. All of the ".md" files are the ones you can click on to view here in your browser. However, the HTML versions are what were originally meant to be viewed. If you want to see a cleaner web page you can download the ".html" file from a particular project and open it on your computer or copy the url for the file from this repository and enter it in the field on this website: https://htmlpreview.github.io/. I may begin to create pdf versions for ones that are not interactive after learning LaTeX.

This only contains a small portion of my work and some of my projects are confidential. I will continue to upload more content. If you want to see more of my work, you can email me at jimkgreene@gmail.com, explaining what kind of stuff you're looking for. Also, I'm happy to work on some new projects, especially if they are vastly different from anything I have done before.
