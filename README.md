# Creations

Welcome,

I started this repository to serve as a portfolio. I've recently started building a website to replace this that will include some data science tutorials and other fun stuff.

Some navigation tips:
All of the ".md" files can be viewed in your browser by simply clicking on them. The HTML versions are preffered for better viewing. If you want to see a cleaner web page you may download the ".html" file and open it on your computer or prepend the url with "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?" For example: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CUBICinfinity/Creations/blob/master/R/Statistics/6%20-%20Bee%20Repelant%20-%20Permutation%20Experiment.html

As time goes, I update the content included (excluding items that are confidential). If you want to see more of my work, you can email me at jimkgreene@gmail.com explaining what you'd like to see. I'd also be happy to work on any new projects you throw at me. (If you took the time to come here and email me about it, then it deserves some attention.)
