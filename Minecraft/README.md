I like making adventure maps in Minecraft using it's redstone/command_block system. These are my two best ones so far:

BLACK PEARL

This is a puzzle and parkour Minecraft adventure map. This took 80+ hours and over 200 commands.

The map is too large for GitHub, so I uploaded it to Google Drive:

To install, put the Map folder in Saves and the Resource Pack folder in Resource Packs. You must load the resource pack before playing because it contains music, voice recordings, and textures that are essential for the experience.

This map was inspired by Myst and as a result you won't be able to beat it if the music stays muted. Overall, it requires some thought and attention to detail to complete.

ESCAPE ROOM

Unlike Black Pearl, this is a full version and it's available on [MinecraftMaps.com](http://www.minecraftmaps.com/puzzle-maps/escape-room-by-cubic-infinity). It also uses a large number of commands, but the work is focused on a single room. This is one of the best Minecraft Escape Rooms out there (a subjective statement). I received feedback from some of the players and one of them said it was like a real escape room. They also thought I should make more escape rooms, which is biased because the ones who played it already like these kinds of maps.
