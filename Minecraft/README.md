#### My Minecraft adventure maps

I enjoy making adventure games with Minecraft's redstone/command_block system. These are my two best so far:


Black Pearl (Alpha)
----------

This is a sci-fi Minecraft adventure map with advanced mechanics and hidden features.

It is the most extensive individual project I have ever undertaken, and I hope to release the beta in late April 2019. I used to keep a link to the map on Google Drive, but I've closed it from the public. You can view the included screenshots.

It runs in vanilla Minecraft and includes a resource pack that loads automatically. The pack has replaced textures, advancements, music files, and voice recordings.


Escape Room by Cubic Infinity
----------

Unlike Black Pearl, this is a full version and it's available on [MinecraftMaps.com](http://www.minecraftmaps.com/puzzle-maps/escape-room-by-cubic-infinity). It uses a large number of command blocks, but the work is focused on a single room. I received feedback from some of the players (mostly positive) and one of them said it was like a real escape room. They also thought I should make more of them.
